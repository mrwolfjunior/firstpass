# ⚡ Firstpass

### The verification layer for LLM serving. Nothing ships until a real check passes.

**On 974 real coding tasks it recovered +15.2 points of quality over the cheap model alone — and made _zero_ of those 974 tasks worse.** At 12–57% lower cost per success, depending on how expensive your top rung is.

Your check — your tests, your schema, your judge — runs on **every answer before it is served**. What passes ships; what fails escalates and is checked again. Every decision leaves a **hash-chained receipt** you can re-derive, and wrong answers are capped by a **distribution-free guarantee** rather than a promise.

Routing falls out of that. Because the cheapest model clears the gate most of the time, you stop paying frontier prices for work that never needed them — but the cost saving is the **consequence**, not the mechanism.

## Proof over prediction

Almost every way of choosing a model decides **before the output exists** — a classifier reads your
prompt and guesses, or a gateway picks on price and availability. Guess wrong and you find out in
production, with no artifact explaining why.

Firstpass is not in that race. It decides **after** the output exists, which is the only point at
which the question "is this good enough to serve?" can actually be answered.

Firstpass decides by **proof**. It opens on the cheapest model in your ladder, then **gates the actual output** — runs your tests, checks a schema, asks a judge, or measures self-consistency. Pass → it serves. Fail → it escalates exactly one rung and gates again. The cheap model handles most traffic; the frontier model is spent **only when the cheap one is provably not enough**. Every decision is a tamper-evident, hash-chained receipt you (or an auditor) can re-derive independently — and a **distribution-free bound caps how often a wrong answer is served**.

> **Cheap until proven otherwise.** You pay frontier prices only when a real check proves you must.

The cascade-with-verification idea is not ours — FrugalGPT published it in 2023 and AutoMix
refined it in 2024. What no paper or product ships is the receipt, the served-failure bound, and
adding a model without retraining anything. [What we borrow and what is new →](docs/related-work.md)

**Where this fits, stated plainly.** Verification needs something to verify against, so Firstpass is
strongest where "correct" is checkable — code with tests, structured output against a schema,
extraction, anything with an oracle. For open-ended prose the available gates are a judge or
k-sample self-consistency, and on our own measurements a judge gate did not pay for itself once its
calls were metered. If your output has no check, this is the wrong tool and we would rather say so
here than after you have deployed it.

The measured consequence, on 974 real coding tasks: gating lifted quality **+15.2 points** over serving
the cheap model alone (95% CI [+12.9, +17.5]) and **regressed not one of the 974** — because a rung is
only ever spent after a check says the cheap answer is not good enough, and on this workload the gate
never once rejected an answer that was already right. [See the numbers](#the-proof), including the
ones that qualify them.

## How it works

<div align="center"><img src="assets/how.svg" alt="Four moves: 1 Route — open the cheapest rung of the ladder. 2 Prove — gate the real output with tests, a schema, or a judge. 3 Escalate — one rung up only on gate failure, budget-capped. 4 Learn — outcomes feed back so the serve threshold self-tunes. Learn loops back to Route." width="900"></div>

1. **Route** — every request opens on the cheapest rung of your model ladder. No per-prompt classifier picks the model; the cheap model simply takes the first pass.
2. **Prove** — a *gate* checks the actual output: your unit tests, a JSON schema, an LLM judge, self-verification, or self-consistency. It reads the real answer, not the prompt.
3. **Reflect (Optional)** — on gate failure, a larger mentor model can diagnose the error and prompt the executor to fix it iteratively before escalating, leveraging local **Reflexion Loops** for speed and quality.
4. **Escalate** — only on Reflexion exhaustion or gate failure: one rung up, budget-capped, with cross-provider failover on a 5xx.
5. **Learn** — outcomes feed back via `/v1/feedback`; the serve threshold self-tunes so the guarantee tracks your live traffic. **No policy model to retrain, ever.**

> **Who decides a request needs the expensive model?** The gate — from the cheap model's *actual answer*. Never a classifier guessing from the prompt. Change what "good" means by editing a gate; there's nothing to retrain.

<div align="center"><img src="assets/gate-wrapper.svg" alt="How a test suite becomes a Firstpass gate. The model's reply arrives as JSON on stdin; run-tests.py extracts the code from its Markdown fences, writes it to a temp directory with your test files, and runs your real command. Three outcomes: all tests pass, so the gate returns pass with score 1.0 and the answer is served; some tests fail, so it returns fail with the pass fraction as a graded score and the ladder escalates; or the runner itself is missing, so it returns abstain rather than a fabricated verdict." width="900"></div>

## The proof

The claim no predictive router makes: on **974 real MBPP coding tasks** (fail-closed sandbox, real unit-test gates — [committed artifact](docs/benchmarks/mbpp-live-base.txt)), Firstpass earned a **distribution-free bound of ≤10% wrong answers served at 95% confidence** — calibrated risk **5.5%**, realized served-failure **7.7%** at the threshold — while serving **82%** of requests from the cheap tier.

<div align="center"><img src="assets/guarantee.svg" alt="On 974 real MBPP tasks with real test gates: served-failure is 5.5% calibrated risk and 7.7% realized, both under the ≤10% distribution-free target line at 95% confidence; 82% of requests are served from the cheap tier, only 18% escalate. Pre-registered α=0.10, δ=0.05." width="900"></div>

The bound is a Hoeffding upper confidence bound — **valid for any data distribution**, no Gaussian assumptions. It's computed from a real run, not assumed. Your savings depend on your workload, which is why every trace records the always-frontier counterfactual: **you measure your number instead of trusting ours.**

### …and whether routing beat simply picking one model

A guarantee is only half the question. The other half is whether any of this beats picking one model
and living with it, so the same 974 tasks were replayed under each policy on identical measurements
([sonnet ladder](docs/benchmarks/mbpp-policy-974.txt) · [opus ladder](docs/benchmarks/mbpp-policy-974-opus.txt)).

**The headline: the gate never made a task worse.** Not one of 974, on either ladder. It escalates on
19% of traffic, 80% of those escalations turn a wrong answer into a right one, and nothing it did cost
a task that the cheap model had already got right.

| | vs **always-cheap** | vs **always-top** |
|---|---|---|
| quality | **+15.2 points** (paired, 95% CI [+12.9, +17.5]) | −2.3 points (95% CI [−3.5, −1.1]) |
| tasks | **~150 recovered, 0 regressed** | 28 lost, 6 won |
| cost | +$1.71 total | **57% lower per success** |

That asymmetry is worth being precise about, because it is a property of *this workload* and not a
law. Escalation can only make things worse in one specific way: the gate rejects a cheap answer that
was actually correct, and the rung above then gets it wrong. On these 974 tasks the first half never
happened — **zero correct cheap answers were rejected**, matching the 0.0% false-reject rate in the
guarantee artifact — so the regression path was never entered. A gate that rejects sloppily on your
traffic can regress, which is exactly why the receipts record every verdict and `firstpass ope`
rehearses a policy against your own logs before it enforces anything.

Two honest qualifications, because a number that can't survive scrutiny isn't worth quoting:

- **The saving depends on your ladder, and it is the ladder that moves it.** 57% against an
  `opus` ceiling, **12% against a `sonnet` one** — 81% of traffic never reaches the top rung, so a
  pricier ceiling compounds directly.
- **On MBPP those two ceilings are statistically indistinguishable** (0.9476 vs 0.9456, a 2-task
  difference; an independent re-run of the shared cheap rung flipped 80 of 974 outcomes). So part
  of the 57% is `opus` being the wrong ceiling for this workload rather than routing beating a
  well-chosen baseline. The artifacts say so in their headers.

## Firstpass vs. predictive routers

| | Predictive routers | ⚡ **Firstpass** |
|---|---|---|
| **Decides by** | guessing from the prompt | **proving the real output** |
| **A wrong answer** | ships silently | **caught by the gate, escalated** |
| **Quality guarantee** | none | **≤10% served-failure @ 95%, earned live** |
| **Adapts by** | retraining a policy model | **self-tuning threshold + edit a gate** |
| **Audit trail** | a dashboard number | **hash-chained receipt per decision** |
| **A policy change** | deploy and hope | **rehearsed first: `firstpass ope` replays your logs with CIs** |

And the one good idea predictive routers had — *starting* on the right model — is already **inside** Firstpass: a learned start-rung bandit picks where the ladder begins, prediction errors cost only latency, and the gate still decides what ships.

## The receipt

<details>
<summary><b>🧾 Every decision is a hash-chained trace an auditor can re-derive</b></summary>

```jsonc
{
  "trace_id": "0192f3a1-7c4e-7abc-9d21-4e8b1f0a2c33",
  "prev_hash": "9f2c…a1b7",                          // chains to the prior decision — tamper-evident
  "attempts": [
    { "rung": 0, "model": "anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5", "cost_usd": 0.0007,
      "gates": [{ "gate_id": "cargo-test", "verdict": "fail" }] },   // cheap tried first — gate caught it
    { "rung": 1, "model": "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5", "cost_usd": 0.0121,
      "gates": [{ "gate_id": "cargo-test", "verdict": "pass" }] }    // escalated, proven, served
  ],
  "final": { "served_rung": 1, "total_cost_usd": 0.0128,
             "counterfactual_baseline_usd": 0.0630, "savings_usd": 0.0502 }
}
```

Downstream outcomes flow back via `POST /v1/feedback` onto a deferred-verdict side table that **never alters the sealed record**.

**Independently auditable.** `firstpass export` writes the sealed log as JSONL; anyone — an auditor, a regulator, you — runs `firstpass verify --file receipts.jsonl` on their own machine to re-derive the hash chain from genesis, **no proxy and no database in the loop**. A single altered or reordered receipt breaks the chain at its index and exits non-zero. Black-box routers can't produce this artifact; it's the EU-AI-Act-style logging story, built in.

```

Or through your package manager — each row is live and republishes on every release:

| 📦 **npm** | `npm i -g firstpass-proxy` <sub>(not `firstpass` — that name on npm is an unrelated CLI)</sub> |
| ⬇️ **Binaries** | macOS · Linux · Windows, checksummed, self-updating (`firstpass-proxy-update`) — [Releases](https://github.com/dshakes/firstpass/releases) |

## Quickstart

Three lines. Zero config. **Zero risk** — observe mode changes nothing:

```bash
firstpass-proxy                                     # watches your traffic, touches nothing
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:8080"   # your agent now routes through firstpass
# … use your agent normally — every call gets a receipt: what it'd route, what you'd save
```

Convinced by your own numbers? Switch on routing:

```bash
cp firstpass.example.toml firstpass.toml
FIRSTPASS_MODE=enforce FIRSTPASS_CONFIG=./firstpass.toml firstpass-proxy
```

Or skip the env var entirely and let Firstpass start the agent already pointed at it:

```bash
firstpass launch claude          # also: codex, or `openai -- <any OpenAI-compatible command>`
```

It refuses to start if no proxy is listening — or if something that *isn't* Firstpass is holding the
port — because an agent launched at the wrong address fails in a way that reads like the agent is
broken.

Leaving is `unset ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`. That's the whole offboarding story.

### 🤖 …or let an agent do it — one command does everything

Don't follow docs. Firstpass detects your machine, plans the setup, executes it, and verifies itself:

```console
$ firstpass onboard --apply
detected: shell=zsh · proxy_running=false · routed=false · claude_cli=true

✓ proxy started (pid 17005, observe mode) — log: firstpass-proxy.log
✓ wired ~/.zshrc — export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080
→ optional: claude mcp add firstpass -- firstpass mcp
✓ verified — proxy healthy · capabilities live
```

Auto-detects your shell (zsh/bash/fish), whether the proxy is running, whether you're already routed, and which agents you have — then does only what's missing. **Idempotent** (re-run any time), **transparent** (`firstpass onboard` alone is a dry run showing the exact plan), and **reversible** (`firstpass offboard` strips the shell line, stops the proxy, prints the unset). For agents onboarding *themselves*: [`llms.txt`](llms.txt) + [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) ship machine-readable setup, `GET /v1/capabilities` gives runtime discovery, and `firstpass mcp` exposes traces, savings, evals, policy rehearsal, and receipt verification as tools.

### ⚡ …or just press the button

Three surfaces, no questions asked in any of them:

```console
$ firstpass kiosk          # finds the provider key already in your environment,
                           # writes a config, puts ONE REAL request through the
                           # ladder, prints the receipt. No key? It runs the
                           # keyless demo instead — the button always works.

$ firstpass handshake      # the same thing for a caller with no terminal: one
                           # JSON document — keys found, the config that would
                           # run, a KEYLESS self-test of route→gate→escalate→
                           # serve→receipt→chain, and the env var to route.
                           # It reports; it never writes. Also an MCP tool.
```

And once anything is running, **`GET /panel`** is a live receipts view served by the
binary itself — every rung tried, what the gate said, what it cost against always
calling the top of the ladder. No CDN, no build step, no external origin: the
receipts stay behind the same tenant boundary as `/v1/receipts`.

---

## Architecture

Firstpass is a proxy in front of your provider calls. Your agent keeps its existing endpoint — Firstpass speaks **both inbound wire dialects** and returns a normal response, byte-identical to the served rung.

<div align="center"><img src="assets/architecture.svg" alt="Architecture: your agent calls the proxy on POST /v1/messages (Anthropic dialect) or POST /v1/chat/completions (OpenAI dialect). Inside, the request flows Route → Gate → Escalate → Serve. Rungs call providers with your own keys — anthropic, openai, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint — with failover on 5xx. Every decision writes a SHA-256 hash-chained receipt; deferred outcomes on /v1/feedback tune the serve threshold." width="900"></div>

### Wire APIs

Point anything at it. Firstpass speaks three inbound dialects and translates across vendors, so a
cascade can cross providers without the caller knowing:

| Endpoint | For |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /v1/messages` | Anthropic Messages — Claude Code and anything Anthropic-native |
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI Chat Completions, and every OpenAI-compatible client |
| `POST /v1/responses` | OpenAI Responses — newer OpenAI-family agents, including tool calls |
| `GET /v1/models` | Model discovery, so an agent CLI can populate its picker |

Crossing vendors is handled, not assumed: a caller that sets `reasoning_effort` keeps it when the
ladder escalates onto an Anthropic rung (as `thinking`), and a tool call survives the round trip
through `/v1/responses` in both directions rather than being quietly dropped.

### Providers

Eight OpenAI-compatible platforms work with **no `[[provider]]` block** — name the rung and set the
key: `groq`, `deepseek`, `together`, `fireworks`, `mistral`, `openrouter`, `xai`, `cerebras`,
alongside the built-in `anthropic` and `openai`.

```toml
[[route]]
mode = "enforce"
ladder = ["groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile", "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5"]
gates = ["non-empty"]

[[price]]   # required — see below
model = "groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile"
input_per_mtok = 0.59
output_per_mtok = 0.79
```

**Endpoints ship built in; prices do not, deliberately.** A base URL is a stable fact. A price is
not — these platforms change pricing without notice, and a stale built-in would write a wrong
`cost_usd` into a tamper-evident receipt and mis-feed your `[budget]` caps. So a rung on one of
these still needs an explicit `[[price]]`, and the proxy refuses to start without it, naming the
model and printing the block to paste. `firstpass doctor` also fails loudly when a configured rung's
API key is missing, rather than letting the first real request discover it.

### Every provider, including open-source

A ladder rung is `<id>/<model>` — open on a free local model, escalate to a frontier model only on proven need:

```toml
[[provider]]
id = "groq"                                  # any OpenAI-compatible host — Groq, Together,
dialect = "openai"                           # DeepSeek, Mistral, xAI, Azure, an aggregator,
base_url = "https://api.groq.com/openai"     # or your own Ollama / vLLM box
api_key_env = "GROQ_API_KEY"

[[route]]
match  = {}
mode   = "enforce"
ladder = ["groq/llama-3.3-70b-versatile", "anthropic/claude-sonnet-5"]
gates  = ["unit-tests"]
```

`anthropic` and `openai` are built in; Gemini (`dialect = "gemini"`), AWS Bedrock (`auth = "aws_sigv4"`), and Google Vertex (`auth = "gcp_oauth"`) use the same shape. Every variant ships in [`firstpass.example.toml`](firstpass.example.toml), guarded by a parse test.

> **Verification status, stated plainly.** The Anthropic path is **live-verified end-to-end** (real traffic through the running proxy). The OpenAI-compatible, Gemini, Bedrock, and Vertex adapters are **implemented and offline-tested against recorded wire shapes, pending live verification** — each flips to *verified* when a key-gated CI smoke test exercises it against the real endpoint ([roadmap](docs/roadmap.md), Phase 1).

### Gates — "do I have to write them?"

No. Meet it where you are:

| Effort | You get |
|---|---|
| **None** — observe mode | Firstpass reports what it *would* route and save. Nothing changes. |
| **One sentence** — judge gate | A second model grades every answer against your plain-English rubric. |
| **One config line** — consistency gate | The model answers *k* times; agreement is measured confidence (self-consistency, Wang et al. 2022). |
| **Your existing tests** | The strongest gate: generated code ships only if your suite actually passes. |

Flaky gates auto-disable on an error budget — one bad check can't take down a route.

### Long conversations

Agent sessions get long, and that breaks routers in ways that are invisible until you read a bill:

- **A prompt too large for the cheap rung escalates** instead of failing the request. It is a 400
  from the provider, and treating every 400 as fatal kills a request the next rung up would have
  served. The receipt records it as `context_overflow`, so capacity-forced escalations are not
  pooled with quality failures in your statistics.
- **A session that had to escalate starts there next turn** (`[escalation.session_promotion]`),
  instead of re-paying for the rung that already failed it — with a periodic downward probe so a
  promotion is never a one-way ratchet.
- **Cached prompts are billed as cached.** Prompt caching splits the prompt across three counters
  at three different rates; counting only `input_tokens` reports a 190k-token cached prompt as
  about 20 tokens. Firstpass prices all three, so the receipt and your `[budget]` caps see what the
  call actually cost.
- **A conversation that fits nowhere is condensed rather than refused**
  (`[escalation.condense]`, off by default) — but only once *every* rung has overflowed, where the
  choice is a degraded answer versus none at all.

### Running more than one replica

The verified cache and session promotion are **in-process by default**. Behind a load balancer that
means each replica keeps its own — the same answer is cached N times over, the hit rate drops
roughly by N, and, the part that matters, a retraction only reaches the replica that received the
feedback while the others keep serving an answer that has been disproven.

Point both at Redis to share them:

```toml
[escalation.verified_cache]
ttl_secs  = 900
redis_url = "redis://cache:6379/0"

[escalation.session_promotion]
after_failures = 2
window         = "30m"
redis_url      = "redis://cache:6379/0"
```

Requires a build with the `redis-cache` feature (`cargo install firstpass-proxy --features
redis-cache`). Setting `redis_url` without it, or pointing it at an unreachable server, **fails at
startup** rather than quietly falling back — a cache that silently stays per-replica looks exactly
like one that is working.

### Modes

One header, five profiles — set per request via `x-firstpass-mode` (or per route / env): `cost` · `balanced` · `quality` · `latency` · `max`. Same ladder, different serve threshold and escalation appetite: `cost` serves the cheapest thing that clears the gate, `quality`/`max` climb sooner, `latency` prefers the speculative path.

### The science

Firstpass is precise about what's novel versus assembled from known parts (the cascade itself is prior art):

- **Learned start-rung bandit** — deterministic UCB1, or Thompson sampling with discounted Beta posteriors, drift-forgetting, and logged native-MC propensities ([ADR 0007](docs/adr/0007-thompson-start-rung.md)). Predicts where to *start*; the gate still decides what to *serve*.
- **The guarantee** — split-conformal (Hoeffding UCB) or **Learn-then-Test / RCPS** exact-binomial testing (`firstpass calibrate --method ltt`), tracked live under drift by **adaptive conformal** (Gibbs–Candès). Two Prometheus gauges expose the loop: `firstpass_serve_threshold`, `firstpass_realized_served_failure`.
- **Off-policy evaluation** — `firstpass ope` replays your logged receipts against a candidate ladder with IPS / SNIPS / DR estimators and confidence intervals: **rehearse a policy change before you ship it**.
- **Elastic verification** *(validated research, phase-1 shipped, not default-on)* — a cheap *k*-sample probe decides how much proof to spend: unanimous-wrong escalates immediately, unanimous-right serves without the expensive gate, only the uncertain middle pays for it ([ADR 0008](docs/adr/0008-elastic-verification.md)).

<div align="center"><img src="assets/elastic.svg" alt="Elastic verification: a cheap 5-sample probe decides how much verification to spend. Agreement 0/5 → escalate now (12% of traffic, 0% oracle-correct). Agreement 1–4/5 → run the full gate (23%, mixed). Agreement 5/5 → serve without the expensive gate (65%, 99% oracle-correct). 77% of traffic is decided by the cheap probe alone. Validated, k=5, n=150." width="900"></div>

**Endpoints:** `POST /v1/messages` (Anthropic drop-in) · `POST /v1/chat/completions` (OpenAI drop-in) · `POST /v1/feedback` · `GET /v1/capabilities` · `GET /healthz` · `GET /metrics`.

Multi-tenant deployments add per-tenant auth (Argon2id), rate limits, gate-health scoping, and AES-256-GCM key custody — all opt-in, default-off ([ADR 0004](docs/adr/0004-hosted-multitenant-plane.md)).

## Status

**v0.3.0 — pre-GA, shipped in the open.** Honest about the line between shipped and researched.

| ✅ Shipped & verified | 🔬 Next / research |
|---|---|
| Both wire dialects, structured enforce **default-on** | Elastic verification (validated, phasing in) |
| All five gate kinds + per-gate `on_abstain` | Cross-dialect structured translation beyond Anthropic↔OpenAI |
| Start-rung bandit (UCB1 / Thompson), speculation, failover | Four provider dialects await live wire verification |
| Conformal guarantee + Learn-then-Test | 30-day soak, external security audit |
| Adaptive threshold, OPE, `savings` / `evals` | Hosted multi-tenant plane |
| Receipts + export/verify + durable mode | crates.io publish |
| Modes, per-deployment `[[price]]`, Grafana dashboard, nightly provider-smoke CI | |

GA is a checklist we publish ([ADR 0003](docs/adr/0003-production-ga-readiness.md)), not an adjective — the exact remaining items (secrets, soak clock, external audit) are enumerated in the [GA handoff](docs/ga-handoff.md).
