//! UCB1 start-rung bandit: predict-to-start, verify-to-serve.
//!
//! # Science
//!
//! Every request currently starts the escalation ladder at rung 0 (cheapest model). Many
//! contexts (task kind × prompt-size bucket) have a learned empirical pass rate per rung: if
//! rung 0 almost never passes for a given context, always starting there wastes money. This
//! module learns a per-context start rung that minimises expected cost while the enforce gate
//! still verifies the chosen rung's output before serving.
//!
//! **The invariant (predict-to-start, verify-to-serve):** the bandit only controls where the
//! ladder *starts*. Gating, escalation, budget, and speculation are untouched. If the predicted
//! start rung's output fails the gate, the ladder continues upward as normal — no downward
//! retry. Prediction errors can cost money (latency, slightly higher expected cost when the
//! estimate is wrong) but can never cause a wrong answer to be served.
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! UCB1 (Auer et al. 2002) applied to cost-sensitive start-rung selection. For each candidate
//! start s, the expected cost is:
//!
//! ```text
//! E[s] = Σ_{r=s}^{top-1}  price_r · P(reach r | start s)
//! P(reach r | start s) = Π_{q=s}^{r-1} (1 − p̂_q)
//! p̂_q = clamp(successes_q / n_q  +  c · √(ln N / n_q),  0, 1)
//! ```
//!
//! where `N` is the total gate-verdict observations in this context, `n_q` is the observations
//! at rung `q`, and `c` is the exploration constant (default 1.0). Tie → lower s (conservative).
//!
//! **Prices are evaluated at the request's own size**, derived from the context's prompt-token
//! band ([`ContextBucket::representative_prompt_tokens`]). This used to use fixed nominal tokens
//! on the reasoning that "relative prices are what matters" — which measurement disproved.
//!
//! For two rungs the argmin above reduces to `start cheap ⟺ c₀ < p·c₁`, so what the cheap attempt
//! costs *relative to what it can save* is the entire decision. With a constant token count that
//! ratio is identical for every request, and the rule degenerates to a function of `p` alone.
//! That throws away the signal that makes it pay: on 974-task MBPP, escalation is **adversely
//! selected ~2.16×** — requests that fail the gate cost ~2.2× more at the cheap rung *and* ~2.1×
//! more at the top rung, because hard requests are long requests. Offline replay of the measured
//! matrix put the corrected rule 22% below plain first-pass at slightly *higher* accuracy. Sizing
//! the price at the actual request is what lets this bandit see that.
//!
//! **Cold-start safety:** if the context has fewer than `min_observations` total gate verdicts,
//! the bandit returns rung 0 (byte-identical to today's behavior). Abstain verdicts are not
//! counted (only clear Pass/Fail gate outcomes are informative).
//!
//! # State
//!
//! ponytail: in-memory `Mutex`, per-process. Survives restarts via warm-start replay of the
//! trace store at startup. No persistence of its own — the trace store is the durable record.
