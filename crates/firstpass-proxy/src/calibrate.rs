//! Recalibrate the serving threshold from real deferred feedback (SPEC §10.1, run against live
//! traffic instead of a static benchmark suite) — the "learns your quality bar" loop.
//!
//! Three calibration methods are available:
//! - **conformal** (default): split-conformal with Hoeffding bound — [`calibrate_from_store`].
//! - **ltt**: Learn-then-Test / RCPS with exact-binomial fixed-sequence testing —
//!   [`calibrate_from_store_ltt`].
//! - **eprocess**: anytime-valid risk control — [`calibrate_from_store_eprocess`].
//!
//! All three enumerate stored traces, pair each trace that has a deferred outcome with the score of
//! the attempt actually served, and hand the pairs to the respective core module. None feeds
//! back into the request hot path — that wiring is a deliberate follow-on once an operator has
//! reviewed a report.
//!
//! ## Which one to run, and why there are three
//!
//! The first two are **fixed-sample**: they answer "given this calibration set, what threshold is
//! safe?", and their guarantees are stated over that one set. That is the right question when an
//! operator recalibrates deliberately, reviews the report, and adopts a threshold.
//!
//! It is the wrong question when calibration runs continuously. Re-running a fixed-sample method
//! whenever more feedback lands, and adopting the winner each time, is optional stopping on a
//! growing stream — each individual run is valid while the sequence of adoptions is not. `eprocess`
//! exists for that regime: its bound holds at **every** round, so re-reading it as often as you like
//! costs nothing in validity. It pays for that in conservatism, and
//! [`firstpass_core::eprocess`] documents the trade rather than burying it.
