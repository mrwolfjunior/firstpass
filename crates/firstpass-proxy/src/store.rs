//! Tamper-evident trace storage: a background SQLite writer fed by a bounded channel.
//!
//! The hot request path never blocks on disk: it `try_send`s a [`Trace`] down a bounded channel
//! and returns immediately (dropping the trace if the writer has fallen far enough behind to fill
//! the buffer — bounded memory over a guaranteed write). A single background task owns the SQLite
//! connection, assigns each trace's `prev_hash` from the current chain head, computes its `hash`,
//! and appends it (SPEC §9: the hash chain is only meaningful if every writer agrees on chain
//! order, which a single writer task guarantees for free).
//!
//! In [`crate::config::ReceiptsMode::Durable`] mode the channel-full path spills traces to
//! `<db_path>.spill.jsonl` (one JSON line per trace, synced to disk) instead of dropping them.
//! The writer drains the spill file at startup and whenever the channel empties, inserting spilled
//! traces BEFORE new channel arrivals so the hash chain stays append-only and valid.
