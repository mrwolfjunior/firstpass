//! A response cache that can only ever return an answer which **passed a gate**.
//!
//! ## Why this is not the same feature everyone else ships
//!
//! A conventional semantic or exact cache stores whatever the model said and replays it. It saves
//! money by skipping the model — and skipping the model is exactly how a gateway stops knowing
//! whether the thing it just served was any good. On a cache hit rate of 40%, a product whose claim
//! is "nothing ships until a real check passes" would be shipping 40% of its traffic unchecked.
//!
//! So insertion is the gate here, not lookup: an entry is written **only** when the request it came
//! from was served on a passing verdict. A failed answer, a best-effort serve after budget
//! exhaustion, an abstain — none of them are cacheable, because replaying one would launder an
//! unverified answer into a served one and no later reader could tell.
//!
//! The receipt records `served_from: cache` and `cache_source: <trace_id>`, so a hit is not the
//! word "cached" but a link to the decision whose gate passed. That is the difference between
//! asserting a saving and being able to prove what was served.
//!
//! ## What it is keyed on
//!
//! The salted prompt hash the router already computes, plus the ladder identity. Exact-match, not
//! semantic: two prompts that merely *look* similar can want different answers, and a verification
//! product guessing that they don't is the one shortcut it cannot take. Semantic matching would
//! need its own gate over the similarity decision, which is a bigger design than a cache.
//!
//! The ladder is part of the key because the same prompt under a different ladder is a different
//! question — an answer proven against one gate configuration says nothing about another.
