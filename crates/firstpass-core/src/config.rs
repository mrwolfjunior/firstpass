//! Routing configuration (SPEC §8.4) — declarative, agent-first.
//!
//! Config is the policy an operator (or agent) hands Firstpass: an ordered list of routes,
//! each matching a slice of traffic to a mode, a model ladder, and gates; plus budget caps
//! and escalation rules. The first matching route wins, so specific routes go first and a
//! bare `match = {}` catch-all goes last.
