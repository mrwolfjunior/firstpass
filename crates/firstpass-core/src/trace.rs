//! The audit trace (SPEC §9.1) — the tamper-evident record of one routing decision.
//!
//! A trace captures *why* a request went where it did and *what it cost*: the features it was
//! routed on, every attempt and its gate verdicts, the final served outcome, and the savings
//! versus always calling the top rung. Each record links to the previous via [`Trace::prev_hash`]
//! (see [`crate::hashchain`]), so the log is append-only and any tampering is detectable.
//!
//! **The serde field names in this module are the wire/audit contract.** External auditors
//! parse them and re-derive the hash chain; renaming one is a breaking change that requires a
//! schema/version bump, never a silent edit.
